# 🚀 MERN JWT Authentication Demo

Welcome to the **MERN_JWT** repository - a simple demonstration of authentication using JWT in MERN stack web applications! This project showcases how to implement JWT authentication in a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. 

## 📦 Repository Content

In this repository, you will find the source code for a demo app that includes functionality for user registration, login, and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The repository covers key topics such as ***bun, express, jwt-authentication, mailtrap, mern-auth, mern-authentication, mern-stack, mongodb, mongoose, nodejs, react, and typescript***.
